# Automated Pre-Deployment Error Analyzer

Deployments often fail in tools such as **Ansible Tower** and **XL Release**.  
Engineers spend 15â€“30 minutes reading logs to find root causes.  

**This tool** automatically analyzes deployment logs, detects failure patterns, and suggests fixes â€” saving time and making issue triage consistent.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals (MVP)
- Ingest log files (Ansible Tower / XL Release)
- Normalize to a unified JSON schema
- Detect failure patterns via rules + ML
- Expose a .NET WebAPI endpoint
- Angular UI: upload log â†’ see categorized issues
- Store runs and metrics in SQL (SQLite â†’ Azure SQL later)
- Containerized with Docker â†’ deployable on AKS later
